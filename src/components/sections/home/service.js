									The collection was illustrated with unimaginable detail and is made up of over 250 traits or variations.

									The game mechanics and game progressions are unique to specific NFT metadata. Not all avatars are equal. Primus

									The game economy was constructed to be sustainable but exciting, complex, and scalable.
