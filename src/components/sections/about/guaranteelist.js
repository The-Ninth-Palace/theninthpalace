                      The storyline for The Ninth Palace is original, unique, and well thought out. It’s meant to be a reminder to all of us that the most important things in life aren’t valued in fiat or crypto. There are three narrative themes central to the plot: Time, Freedom, and Privacy.

                      We follow the lead characters into a dystopian, futuristic world inspired by the works of Neal Stephenson, The Wachowski’s “The Matrix,” and old novels from John le Carré. The new government has built this Orwellian world where society has ceded all control of their lives to the Modgnik Detinu.

                      One and Five are thrust into the spotlight as survivors of The Ninth Palace. Throughout the story they’re both met with challenges a bit more emotional than gamers may anticipate. This is a game full of emotion and double meaning.

                      <br/> <br/>
The technology developed for this project specifically is not at all proprietary. However, we’ve utilized most of it in ways never before seen in our community. The mint contract is a novel contract meant reduce gas fees across multiple mints and may be the most efficient contract ever written.
<br/> <br/>
Our backend design, the Gamer Tag system, is all built using technology widely available. We’ve simply configured it to work in a way that makes it easier for non-native crypto users to adopt. We utilize our own version of SSO and ENS logins.

                      and the future is the brightest here. We are building the games, both mobile and PC versions, using the Unity engine.

                      This is the single most important pain point for P2E gaming moving into the next generation of builds. We didn’t look at any other builds. We didn’t compare our design to their design. We don’t believe in the current fundamentals around designing P2E economies.
                      <br/> <br/>
We’ve created our own. Our design was compared against actual nation state economies in the modern world. We wanted to make sure we had multiple levers to control the economy in the event it needed steering but enough momentum in either direction to maintain healthy balances.
<br/> <br/>
We factored in scarcity, automated minting/burning on a curve in a way that’s simply never been attempted before, and ensured all of this was intimately connected to the real world revenue from the game.

The actual design will be slowly added to Nuclino piece by piece.

                        We have gone through the Web3 additions painstakingly to ensure the Securus Protocol is realistic, the company is sustainable, and the in-game economy is as far from "ponzinomics" as possible. 
                        Play-to-Earn doesn't not mean "unsustainable," and the idea is to illustrate that with a AAA-Tier game.  */}
