                        The storyline for The Ninth Palace, and the subset for the mobile game, are well thought out and unique. 
                        We follow the lead character into this dystopian, futuristic, and Orwellian world where society has ceded all control of governance to a single group - Modgnik Detinu. 
                        One is thrust into the spotlight and presented with endless intellectual challenges along the way. 
                        This is a game full of codes, ciphers, and hidden meanings. An FPS for thinkers.

                      We are releasing the project on the Ethereum Blockchain. It was not an easy decision. 
                      Polygon and ImmutableX both looked like viable options. We genuinely feel that the strength of the Ethereum chain is unmatched, 
                      and the future is the brightest here. We are building the games, both mobile and PC versions, using the Unity engine. 
                      The game is decision-based and outcomes will look different for individual players.

                        The number one question we answer at the top of every storyboard is: 
                        Will this be around in 5-years? The crux of the project has been centered around sustainability. 
                        We started this as a video game totally unconnected to Web3 in any way. 
                        We have gone through the Web3 additions painstakingly to ensure the Securus Protocol is realistic, the company is sustainable, and the in-game economy is as far from "ponzinomics" as possible. 
                        Play-to-Earn doesn't not mean "unsustainable," and the idea is to illustrate that with a AAA-Tier game.
